# Nodejs

## Overview
In our app we make the transition from the client to the server. The JavaScript you wrote for your first project was executed entirely on the client-side, though it made use of third-party server-side APIs. In this, and following units, we will learn how to write our own server-side applications to handle requests and ultimately build our own APIs.

In a previous era, this is the point in our full-stack journey where we would begin learning a second programming language, such as PHP, to write server-side code. Lucky for us, Node.js was released in 2009. Node.js is an implementation of the V8 JavaScript engine _without_ Chrome, allowing us to write server-side code using JavaScript. Additionally, we no longer need a browser to run JavaScript. We can (and will) do so from the command line.
